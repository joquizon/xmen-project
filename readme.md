The X-Men database project was inspired by on a January 2015 article by IGN.com's Scott Collura.It was created as an exercise to utilize jquery's.load function. The page provides an interactive timeline about membership to the X-Men team throughout the years and gives information on any X-Man typed in the input field. It is currently live and can be visited here http://jcqfolio.com/xmen â€” Edit
